    <p>Read the premise, hypothesis and realation, select a segment from premise that can determine the relation between premise and hypothesis.</p>

      <li>On the basis of your own judgement, select a "sequential" segment from premise that can determine the relation between premise and hypothesis.</li>

    <p>The following section is the definition of the three realations, which comes from the RTE-5 task guideline. If you are familiar with NLI tasks such as SNLI, MNLI, RTE, you can skip the section below.</p>
    <p>We define textual entailment as a directional relationship between a pair of text fragments, which we call the "Premise" and the "Hypothesis". We say that: </p>
    <p><strong><i>Premise entails Hypothesis, if a human reading premise would infer that hypothesis is most likely true. </i></strong></p>
    <p>For example, given assumed common background knowledge of the business news domain and the following premise: </p>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><strong><i>Premise1 Internet media company Yahoo Inc. announced Monday it is buying Overture Services Inc. in a $1.63-billion (U.S.) cash-and-stock deal that will bolster its on-line search capabilities.</i></strong></p>
    <p>the following hypothesis is entailed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.1 Yahoo boutght Overture</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.2 Overture acquired by Yahoo</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.3 Overture was bought</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.4 Yahoo is an internet company</i></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the following hypothesis are contradicted by Premise above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.5 Overture bought Yahoo</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.6 Yahoo sold Overture</i></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the following ones cannot be judged on the basis of Premise above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.7 Yahoo manufatures cars</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.8 Overture shareholders will receive $4.75 cash and 0.6108 Yahoo stock for each of their shares.</i></p></li>
    </ul>

Lebanon is preparing for a crucial parliamentary election in June in which Saad Hariri and his political allies now in the majority are facing an alliance led by Hezbollah.

      <p class="card-text">First identified in 1930 swine flu is a common and sometimes fatal respiratory disease in pigs caused by type A influenza virus. The disease does not normally spread to humans though infections are sporadically recorded especially among people who have been directly exposed to pigs. The recent cases in Mexico and the United States however appear to have spread through human contact. From December 2005 through February 2009 only 12 cases of swine influenza were reported in the United States. In 1988 a pregnant woman died after contact with sick pigs. In 1976 swine flu at an U.S. military base at Fort Dix New Jersey killed one soldier. Four were hospitalized with pneumonia. At first experts feared the strain was related to the Spanish Flu of 1918 which killed millions but the strain never spread beyond the base.</p>

Tuesday's election will pit Republican Jim Tedisco a 58-year-old state legislator for 27 years against Democrat Scott Murphy a 39-year-old businessman who has the backing of President Barack Obama and influential unions. Voters will choose the successor to Kirsten Gillibrand who is now a U.S. senator.

      <p class="card-text">Lib Dem justice spokesman David Howarth said the footage showed a "sickening and unprovoked attack" by police. The IPCC is investigating and said it would examine the footage. The pictures shot at 1929 BST (1829 GMT) at Royal Exchange Passage initially show Mr Tomlinson who was not protesting walking away from a group of police officers. He then receives a two-handed push from an officer landing heavily before remonstrating with the police. Mr Tomlinson collapsed and died of a heart attack after walking to nearby Cornhill where he received first aid from police.

Anyone found wandering the Alps wearing nothing but a sturdy pair of hiking boots will now be fined. Appenzell is considered one of the most conservative regions of Switzerland it only gave women the vote in 1990. Locals have been outraged by an apparent upsurge of hikers who think the best way to appreciate the mountains is with their clothes off. The vote was taken with a show of hands at Appenzell's annual Landsgemeinde; an open air meeting of all registered voters in the town square.</p>
