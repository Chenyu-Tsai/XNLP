    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Read the premise, hypothesis and realation, select a segment from premise that can determine the relation between premise and hypothesis.</p>

      <li>On the basis of your own judgement, select a "sequential" segment from premise that can determine the relation between premise and hypothesis.</li>

    <p>The following section is the definition of the three realations, which comes from the RTE-5 task guideline. If you are familiar with NLI tasks such as SNLI, MNLI, RTE, you can skip the section below.</p>
    <p>We define textual entailment as a directional relationship between a pair of text fragments, which we call the "Premise" and the "Hypothesis". We say that: </p>
    <p><strong><i>Premise entails Hypothesis, if a human reading premise would infer that hypothesis is most likely true. </i></strong></p>
    <p>For example, given assumed common background knowledge of the business news domain and the following premise: </p>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><strong><i>Premise1 Internet media company Yahoo Inc. announced Monday it is buying Overture Services Inc. in a $1.63-billion (U.S.) cash-and-stock deal that will bolster its on-line search capabilities.</i></strong></p>
    <p>the following hypothesis is entailed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.1 Yahoo boutght Overture</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.2 Overture acquired by Yahoo</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.3 Overture was bought</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.4 Yahoo is an internet company</i></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the following hypothesis are contradicted by Premise above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.5 Overture bought Yahoo</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.6 Yahoo sold Overture</i></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the following ones cannot be judged on the basis of Premise above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.7 Yahoo manufatures cars</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.8 Overture shareholders will receive $4.75 cash and 0.6108 Yahoo stock for each of their shares.</i></p></li>

      <p class="card-text">However the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC) has come to an agreement with the Cuban government to allow medical students who studied in Cuba to go through a less rigorous examination. Furthermore the MEC wants to exempt the students from the Cuban Escola Latino Americana de Medicina (Latin American Medicine School) or ELAM located in Havana from the examination. Under the agreement the diplomas of ELAM students would be automatically recognized as valid in Brazil. The Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva signed the endorsement of this agreement last year during his visit to Cuba.</p>

      <p class="card-text">The ACS developed jointly by four American agencies was installed in March of 2002. It is a system of three cameras filters and dispersers which act to detect wavelengths of light ranging from near-infrared to ultraviolet. It is a system that was designed to last five years according to Preston Burch associate director and program manager for the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA also indicated that the other four main systems on the telescope remain unaffected and functioning normally. Research work will resume this week using those systems. A scheduled mission to the space telescope in 2008 is expected to deliver instruments to further upgrade the capabilities of the telescope. It is not known what the effect of the ACS failure will have on the scheduled mission.</p>

The plane was carrying 12 Indonesian military personnel and 6 civilians including a British Singaporean and Indian national. The plane was tasked to test a new digital camera designed to conduct aerial mapping and topography. The aircraft was last sighted on radar in the Salak moutain region on the main island of Java 90 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital. The Indonesian military has deployed a search and rescue team in the area. Authorities fear that the aircraft crashed in a densely forested area making any rescue difficult.

      <p class="card-text">Prof. Sali Tagliamonte a professor of linguistics at the University of Toronto said parents and teachers shouldn't be concerned that this new medium is corrupting young people's grammar. "I don't think parents have to worry because they're really showing that they are creative and that they have a mastery of the language. They are not using ruinous language" he said. "What these kids are doing is showing us that they have a really good command of the English language so much so that I was really blown away by how fluidly they operate" he added. The research was presented today at the annual meeting of the Linguistics Association of Canada and the United States.</p>

      <p class="card-text">The South African government has set a six-month deadline for some white farmers to agree on sale prices for their farms. The government will be requiring them to sell the farms as part of its land redistribution programme. Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Lulu Xingwana said that if no agreement is reached in 6 months the government could expropriate farmlands. Stating that negotiations have been too slow in some cases taking many years Xingwana said that some farm owners were seeking "unrealistic prices". Land owners claim they are not offered market value for their property.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Following misleading reports that Rev Professor Michael Reiss had advocated that creation should be taught in science class he left his post as director of education at the Royal Society the UK's national academy of science. Last week at the British Association's science festival Rev  Professor Michael Reiss said that creation should not be ignored if it come up in class. Professor Reiss who was director of education at the Royal Society said that since a substantial number of pupils have concerns about the issue they are likely to "detach from" science if their concerns and world view are not addressed. Creation should not be taught he said but if it comes up teachers should be encouraged to explain the science of evolution.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Track Star Marion Jones winner of 3 gold medals in the 2000 Sydney Olympics has tested positive for the performance enhancing drug EPO. The hormone helps create extra red blood cells which allows the user's body to absorb extra oxygen. Jones was expected to compete in yesterday's Golden League meet in Zurich Switzerland but left early in the morning for "personal reasons." It was announced earlier today (UTC) that she had tested positive for EPO. Jones faces a two year ban if her B test sample comes back positive. Jones has a history of association with steroid users and dealers. In 1999 her then husband CJ Hunter tested positive for a similar drug Nandralone. He had to withdraw from the 2000 Sydney Olympics and received a two year ban.</p>
