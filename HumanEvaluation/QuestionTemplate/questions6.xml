    <p>The following section is the definition of the three realations, which comes from the RTE-5 task guideline. If you are familiar with NLI tasks such as SNLI, MNLI, RTE, you can skip the section below.</p>
    <p>We define textual entailment as a directional relationship between a pair of text fragments, which we call the "Premise" and the "Hypothesis". We say that: </p>
    <p><strong><i>Premise entails Hypothesis, if a human reading premise would infer that hypothesis is most likely true. </i></strong></p>
    <p>For example, given assumed common background knowledge of the business news domain and the following premise: </p>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><strong><i>Premise1 Internet media company Yahoo Inc. announced Monday it is buying Overture Services Inc. in a $1.63-billion (U.S.) cash-and-stock deal that will bolster its on-line search capabilities.</i></strong></p>
    <p>the following hypothesis is entailed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.1 Yahoo boutght Overture</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.2 Overture acquired by Yahoo</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.3 Overture was bought</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.4 Yahoo is an internet company</i></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the following hypothesis are contradicted by Premise above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.5 Overture bought Yahoo</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.6 Yahoo sold Overture</i></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the following ones cannot be judged on the basis of Premise above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.7 Yahoo manufatures cars</i></p></li>
      <li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large"><p><i>H1.8 Overture shareholders will receive $4.75 cash and 0.6108 Yahoo stock for each of their shares.</i></p></li>

Dr. McCarty said that for a half year from late 1911 to April 1912 when the Titanic set sail the company's board discussed the problem at every meeting. For instance on Oct. 28 1911 Lord William Pirrie the company's chairman expressed concern over the lack of riveters and called for new hiring efforts. In their research the scientists who are metallurgists found that good riveting took great skill. The iron had to be heated to a precise cherry red color and beaten by the right combination of hammer blows. Mediocre work could hide problems.</p>

During the second quarter Starbucks (SBUX Fortune 500) said it cut costs by $120 million better than its target of $100 million and that sales at restaurants open at least 13 months declined at a slower pace than the 9% drop recorded in the first quarter.</p>

      <p class="card-text">This winter's ski season in Europe and the US has been stunning â the snow arrived early fell in heaps and is still falling in many places. Only last weekend an extraordinary 4ft snowfall across Colorado and Wyoming left hundreds of drivers stranded on freeways and brought down power lines. But the future of skiing in many resorts hangs in the balance. The world's highest ski run has closed after running out of snow over several years â the Chacaltaya ski area in Bolivia stood at 5300m (17388ft) on a glacier. Skiing was established at Chacaltaya 70 years ago with Lake Titicaca on the horizon and about 14 years ago could boast a ski run 12m (40ft) deep in snow. Bolivia even had its own Winter Olympics team until 1992.</p>

      <p class="card-text">The same mindset that led to these over-the-top punishments was apparently at play in the strip search of a 13-year-old student by Safford Ariz. school officials in 2003. They were trying to find out whether she had prescription-strength ibuprofen tablets â the equivalent of a couple of Advils hidden in her bra or panties in violation of the "no drugs" policy. No pills were found. Savana Redding then an eighth-grader and now 19 was so humiliated she never went back to the school. Her mother sued the school district and the administrator involved. On Tuesday the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court where the justices will determine whether school officials violated Redding's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and whether she can hold them personally financially responsible.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Norway's premier Jens Stoltenberg issued a curt "We lost a referendum on the EU and so it is not on the agenda now." Oslo has held two referendums on the matter one in 1974 after negotiating an accession agreement and another in 1994. Both times membership was narrowly rejected. Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir said that as part of the coalition agreement her centre-left Social Democratic Alliance had signed with the far-left Left Green Movement the current caretaker government would not apply for membership of the EU. "But let's see what happens after the elections" she said. "At the same time we need 30000 Icelanders to demand a referendum."</p>

Several tremors had been felt in the medieval city of L'Aquila 60 miles north-east of Rome since mid-January and vans with loudspeakers had reportedly driven around the city spreading the warning. But instead of heeding the advice of Mr Giuliani local authorities reported him to police for "spreading alarm" and he was told to remove his findings from the internet.</p>

She said technology education and outreach will curb deaths but funding and staff are also part of the equation. Pietenpol said the National Cancer Institute stands to receive $1.3 billion in stimulus package funds. "We have to look beyond a stimulus package" she said.
