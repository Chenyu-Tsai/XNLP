When a mosquito drinks the blood an infected person the insect also swallows the malaria parasite which then must incubate and multiply before migrating into the insect's saliva. The process can take weeks. And because mosquitoes are small-bodied and cold-blooded outside temperatures make a big difference in how long it takes before they can transmit the disease. If it happens too slowly the insects die before they can infect anyone. In general the malaria parasite does better at warmer temperatures which is why the disease occurs most often in tropical environments. But with mathematical models Thomas has found that even when conditions are warm highly fluctuating temperatures over the course of a day slow down the rate of parasite incubation and larval development in the mosquito.	Warm weather facilitates the spreading of malaria.	malaria parasite does better at warmer temperatures	0	malaria parasite warmer	malaria parasite better warmer temperatures	malaria parasite does better at warmer temperatures

He walked to the world-renowned Al Azhar mosque here where he converted to Islam and to the ornate J.

WEARE N.H. — The black flies were swarming outside Justice David H. Souter's house on a dirt road here last week and the house itself — with peeling paint rotting wood and tattered shades pulled low — looked only slightly more seductive than a mud hut. Yet to Justice Souter who told President Obama last week that he would retire from the Supreme Court in June and return to rural New Hampshire at the relatively young age of 69 this is apparently heaven. In this town of stone walls and bumpy roads he can climb nearby mountains jog unnoticed and one can imagine read by candlelight amid the piles of books said to dominate his house.

Israeli scientists predict the world's coral reefs could begin to collapse in as little as 30 years from now. Studies show the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic as they soak up manmade emissions of carbon dioxide. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem researchers say this will make it difficult for many coral organisms to produce skeletal and other hard parts. The team's work on corals in the Red Sea suggests a tipping point will be reached in between 30 and 70 years. Then the forces of erosion eating away at corals will outstrip the organisms' ability to make the reefs.

This gap in knowledge makes earthquake prediction a frustrating and chancy exercise and complicates the effort to calculate the risk that a human construction like a water reservoir or a geothermal power plant could inadvertently set off a deadly quake. Last month Giampaolo Giuliani a technician who works on a neutrino experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy issued an urgent warning that a large earthquake was about to strike the Abruzzo region. The prediction was based on measurements he had made of high levels of radon gas presumably released from rocks that were being ground up by the stresses of an incipient quake.

The four — Jamil al-Sayyed Ali Hajj Raymond Azar and Mustafa Hamdan — directed the chief security and intelligence services and the presidential guard. They were widely seen as henchmen for Syria which occupied Lebanon militarily for three decades. Widely believed to have ordered Rafik Hariri's killing Syria was forced out of Lebanon under local and international pressure a few months later. Lebanon is preparing for a crucial parliamentary election in June in which Saad Hariri and his political allies now in the majority are facing an alliance led by Hezbollah. Many here believe that the tribunal's decision could cut into Mr. Hariri's votes by spreading the impression that Syria could escape being brought to account for the assassination of his father and be emboldened to rebuild its influence here.

First identified in 1930 swine flu is a common and sometimes fatal respiratory disease in pigs caused by type A influenza virus. The disease does not normally spread to humans though infections are sporadically recorded especially among people who have been directly exposed to pigs. The recent cases in Mexico and the United States however appear to have spread through human contact. From December 2005 through February 2009 only 12 cases of swine influenza were reported in the United States. In 1988 a pregnant woman died after contact with sick pigs. In 1976 swine flu at an U.S. military base at Fort Dix New Jersey killed one soldier. Four were hospitalized with pneumonia. At first experts feared the strain was related to the Spanish Flu of 1918 which killed millions but the strain never spread beyond the base.

Cancer survivors who were a mean age of 4.6 years when first diagnosed often had more physical visual and hearing disability impairments as complications of treatment but they did not have a higher rate of grade repetition. Indeed the rates between the cancer and non-cancer groups were similar at about 22 per cent. Another positive finding was that there were no significant differences in achievements on Grade 12 provincial exams between the study groups. Lead investigator Mary McBride and radiation oncologist Dr. Karen Goddard said in an interview that radiation treatment has helped improve childhood survival outcomes to 80 per cent in the past decade but it is also a leading culprit as far as educational difficulties go.

The two primes were announced by GIMPS on September 16. Before these two discoveries the two previously largest known prime numbers were discovered by UCMO professors Curtis Cooper and Steven Boone in Missouri United States and their record lasted almost three years. Historically prime numbers discovered by GIMPS are larger than the one previously found. The only other exception was when the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and 31st were found. Founded by M.I.T. graduate George Woltman in 1996 GIMPS has found 12 Mersenne primes or about one per year on average.

When it comes to paying taxes to the state it does not count if you are dead of alive. One proof of that is Angelina Jolie's mother who died in 2007.

Here is how they come out with this amount: she owes 43699 in back taxes plus 10924.75 in penalties and 8304.95 in interest for a grand total of 62928.70.

"A 911 call that brought two police officers to a home where they were ambushed and where a third was also later killed during a four-hour siege was precipitated by a fight between the gunman and his mother over a dog urinating in the house. The Saturday argument between Margaret and Richard Poplawski escalated to the point that she threatened to kick him out and she called police to do it according to a 12-page criminal complaint and affidavit filed late Saturday. When officers Paul Sciullo and Stephen Mayhle arrived Margaret Poplawski opened the door and told them to come in and take her 23-year-old son apparently unaware he was standing behind her with a rifle the affidavit said.

In a first ever effort in the United States to eliminate the presence of Zebra mussels in a large body of water the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries VDGIF announced on Monday that a private pond in Prince William County Virginia is undergoing water treatment using a chemical potash of potassium chloride in concentrations high enough to kill invasive and native shellfish species. The pond at the Millbrook Quarry will undergo treatment for three to four weeks in an effort to eliminate an infestation of zebra mussels a condition of its waters that was confirmed by state environmental officials in 2002. The treatment is not expected to pose a threat to non-molluscan aquatic wildlife vegetation or land-dwelling creatures at the site. Officials expect the one-time treatment process will provide protection from the possibility of future infestation for 33 years.	Prince William is a resident of Virginia.

Declan Ganley was the most successful Irish politician of 2008. He won the Lisbon Treaty referendum throwing the Government and opposition into chaotic confusion. He did this democratically. This irritated the losers particularly Dick Roche. As Minister for Europe Roche was significantly at fault for the defeat. He was well-versed in EU Lisbon Treaty intricacies so this was inexcusable. The campaign points made by Ganley throughout 2008 have been consistently ignored; instead personal attacks have been launched. Among actions taken was an unbalanced ill-researched and in my view malicious 'Prime Time' programme. The 'Irish Times' has published exclusively negative stories. There have been 'Village' magazine attacks the latest of these provoking legal action by Ganley now partly resolved.	Declan Ganley is the winner of the Lisbon Treaty referendum.

HANOVER Germany Internet portal and mail-provider Lycos Europe has launched a program to increase spammers' bills by having thousands of voluntary users' computers repeatedly query websites from which spam originates. Such a tactic would increase the bandwidth costs for these websites. However it also faces legal questions. Spamming the mass sending of unsolicited emails is lucrative in part because each email can be sent for nearly insignificant costs. With such low costs a commercial spammer needs only to have a very small number of recipients buy their product to make a profit. The goal of many anti-spam proposals has been to increase the cost of spammers sending messages. Lycos' approach is to make it more expensive to maintain servers that send spam.
