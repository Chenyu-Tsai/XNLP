"The disappearance of York University chef Claudia Lawrence is now being treated as suspected murder, North Yorkshire Police said. However detectives said they had not found any proof that the 35-year-old, who went missing on 18 March, was dead. Her father Peter Lawrence made a direct appeal to his daughter to contact him five weeks after she disappeared. His plea came at a news conference held shortly after a £10,000 reward was offered to help find Miss Lawrence. Crimestoppers said the sum they were offering was ""significantly higher"" than usual because of public interest in the case."	Claudia Lawrence is 35 years old.	0
Any taxpayer earning over £150,000 will no longer enjoy higher-rate tax relief, which is considered a substantial incentive to save for wealthy workers. From April 2011, anyone who earns £200,000 a year, for example, and pays the typical amount of 6 per cent of their salary into their company pension scheme will lose out on £200 a month or £2,400 a year. Alistair Darling, when he announced the move in the Budget, insisted that just 1.5 per cent of taxpayers - the equivalent of about 450,000 people - would be hit, but experts argued that it would significantly damage the already beleaguered pensions industry, and cause many savers to think twice about investing in a pension.	Alistair Darling is chancellor of UK.	1

"Washington - Egyptologists researching a mummy first discovered in 1898 believe it is the mummy of Queen Nefertiti, a legendary beauty and wife of the renegade pharaoh Akhenaten, the Discovery Channel said on Monday. Virtually all traces of Nefertiti and her ""heretic"" husband, who ruled from 1353-1336 BC, were erased after his unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the pantheon of the gods to worship the sun god Aton - among the earliest known practices of monotheism. Nefertiti also was stepmother of the boy-king Tutankhamen, whose tomb was discovered in 1922."	Nefertiti was a queen.	0
"RED VERSUS YELLOW In broad terms, Thailand's crisis is a battle between the ""yellow shirts"" -- royalists, the military and urban Thais, who back Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva -- and the ""red shirts"" -- supporters of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra whose power base was mainly drawn from the country's millions of rural poor. Bureaucratic and military elites have run Thailand for decades, with the poor excluded except during elections when competing parties would try to buy their votes. When Thaksin swept to power in 2000, promising a raft of policies aimed at the poor, things changed."	"The ""yellow shirts"" supports Vejjajiva."	0

"She was finally found at 10.35am the next day by PC David Lloyd George. Something had caught his eye in the undergrowth - her blue school coat or the deep red of the gloves that she had been wearing - and he stepped off the forestry track. Muriel Drinkwater was lying on her back, one arm outstretched by her side, the other slightly raised but with the gloved hand limp. Her eyes were open, but there was no doubt that she was dead. She was just a few weeks short of her 13th birthday. The constable blew sharply on his whistle. The year was 1946, when murder was supposedly less commonplace than now. The killing of Muriel Drinkwater was to make headlines for months and would vex Detective Chief Inspector William ""Bulldog"" Chapman, the Scotland Yard detective who led the inquiry, until his death nine years later."

Israeli scientists predict the world's coral reefs could begin to collapse in as little as 30 years from now. Studies show the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic as they soak up manmade emissions of carbon dioxide. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem researchers say this will make it difficult for many coral organisms to produce skeletal and other hard parts. The team's work on corals in the Red Sea suggests a tipping point will be reached in between 30 and 70 years. Then the forces of erosion eating away at corals will outstrip the organisms' ability to make the reefs.	The acidification of oceans affects tourism.	1

The city retains its spotless streets, immaculate shops and nonexistent crime rate. Since the slowdown, only one manufacturing company has gone bankrupt, says the city's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, because Toyota spread out orders among many of the more than 400 auto parts factories in the city, to keep them afloat through hard times. Nonetheless, Toyota's downturn has rippled through the city's economy, idling many smaller auto-related suppliers, which also cut payrolls, mainly by refusing to renew the contracts of short-term workers. After losing their jobs, many of the city's 16,400 foreign residents, mostly ethnic Japanese from Brazil and Latin America, packed up and left, residents and city officials said.

Skunk is a specific type of cannabis and is so-called because it has a very strong smell, but these days it has become the generic term for stronger forms of the drug. It is regarded as stronger because it contains much higher levels of the active ingredient in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol THC. It also contains much lower levels of cannabidiol CBD, which is an anti-psychotic substance that can moderate the effect of THC on the mental health of users.	"The ""skunk"" cannabis is used to treat mental health problems."	1
Further evidence emerged on Wednesday of the severe downturn in the aviation sector as Emirates pulled its giant Airbus A380s off the Dubai to New York route. The airline blamed the weakening global economy for the decision, an embarrassing U-turn only eight months after its A380 services were launched with the New York route.

A run by Mr. Feinblatt would complicate what is already a three-person race because he most likely would have the support of the powerful mayor, who is running for a third term. Such a move could also irritate the outgoing district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, because it could hurt the chances of his preferred candidate, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. The relationship between Mr. Morgenthau and Mr. Bloomberg has been strained, in part because of the district attorney's investigation into the fire at the former Deutsche Bank building, which found that lapses by the city had contributed to the deaths of two firefighters.

The fowl are technically illegal under New Haven's zoning code, which prohibited raising hens and other livestock when it was updated during the 1950s. But these days, many dozens of backyard hens are generally tolerated under the city's informal enforcement program — call it ""do not cluck, do not tell"" — that mostly looks the other way.

Dr. Eric Goosby, a pioneer in the fight against AIDS, is President Obama's choice to run the American effort to combat the disease globally, the White House announced Monday. The President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, known as Pepfar, was championed by President George W. Bush. It is expected to spend 48 billion over the next five years and is credited with markedly reducing the disease's death rate. Its prevention policy has been controversial because of its emphasis on socially conservative methods. With a new administration and a Democratic majority in the House, organizations seeking prevention choices beyond abstinence and fidelity — including a renewed commitment to distributing condoms — are eager to try to rewrite the guidelines.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan CNN -- Taliban militants made their deepest incursion into Pakistan this week, seizing control of areas that are a short drive from the capital city. A Pakistani government official said the militants fully withdrew from the Buner district on Friday, although other officials cast doubt on the extent of the pullout and how long it would last.

Hunting reef sharks is now banned throughout Maldivian waters. The government decision has made the Indian Ocean archipelago the first nation in the region to outlaw the practice. Shark numbers have plummeted in the Maldives in recent years because a significant minority of fishermen target sharks for their lucrative fins, which are used in shark-fin soup, a luxury Asian dish. Once its fins have been cut off, the shark is often returned to the sea where it suffocates over many painful hours.	Due to the decreasing number of sharks, Maldives have banned the hunt of reef sharks.	0

ARCHEOLOGISTS and forensic experts believe they have identified the skeleton of Cleopatra's younger sister, murdered more than 2,000 years ago on the orders of the Egyptian queen. The remains of Princess Arsinöe, put to death in 41BC on the orders of Cleopatra and her Roman lover Mark Antony to eliminate her as a rival, are the first relics of the Ptolemaic dynasty to be identified. The breakthrough, by an Austrian team, has provided pointers to Cleopatra's true ethnicity. Scholars have long debated whether she was Greek or Macedonian like her ancestor the original Ptolemy, a Macedonian general who was made ruler of Egypt by Alexander the Great, or whether she was north African.	The name of Queen Cleopatra's sister was Arsinöe.	0

Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, seniors at the suburban Denver school, detonated homemade bombs and opened fire with shotguns, a rifle and a semiautomatic handgun on April 20, 1999. They killed a teacher and 12 students and wounded 23 others before committing suicide. The massacre shocked the country like no other. It was the worst school assault in American history at that time, and it came in the wake of a half-dozen others. It played out on live television, watched by millions.

WASHINGTON -- A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice.

China yesterday threw down a challenge to America's 50-year dominance of the global economy as it proposed replacing the dollar as the world's main reserve currency with a new global system under the control of the International Monetary Fund.

The terror attacks, it was clear, had blasted a hole in the dam holding back Mumbai's reservoir of woes.

Israeli scientists predict the world's coral reefs could begin to collapse in as little as 30 years from now. Studies show the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic as they soak up manmade emissions of carbon dioxide. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem researchers say this will make it difficult for many coral organisms to produce skeletal and other hard parts. The team's work on corals in the Red Sea suggests a tipping point will be reached in between 30 and 70 years. Then the forces of erosion eating away at corals will outstrip the organisms' ability to make the reefs.	The coral organisms are endangered by the acidification of oceans.	0

The terror attacks, it was clear, had blasted a hole in the dam holding back Mumbai's reservoir of woes. While the protesters seemed to be reacting to a tragedy that had left at least 164 people dead and 308 injured, they were really venting the frustrations of having to cope with life in a city with an infrastructure so stretched that simply getting to work and back is an ordeal. At peak hour, the commuter trains - which carry six million people each day - are packed with up to 5,000 commuters, even though they're built for 1,800.

Mexico's new president, Felipe Calderon, seems to be doing all the right things in cracking down on Mexico's drug traffickers. He's appointed new people to key military and criminal justice positions, deployed troops to quell drug violence, reasserted federal police power, extradited a few major traffickers to the United States, and given a green light to legislation clarifying Mexico's drug laws.

Last week's release of long-secret Justice Department interrogation memorandums has given rise to starkly opposing narratives about what, if anything, was gained by the C.I.A.'s use of waterboarding, wall-slamming and other physical pressure to shock and intimidate Qaeda operatives. Senior Bush administration officials, led by Vice President Dick Cheney and cheered by many Congressional Republicans, are fighting a rear-guard action in defense of their record. Only by using the harshest methods, they insist, did the intelligence agency get the information it needed to round up Qaeda killers and save thousands of American lives.

[Episcopal News Service] Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners.

WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.	A teenager shot 15 people in Germany.	0

ISSUE 172, March 5, 2009: The world has lost Manx in the Isle of Man, Ubykh in Turkey and last year Alaska's last native speaker of Eyak, Marie Smith Jones, died, taking the Aboriginal language with her. Of the 6,900 languages spoken in the world, some 2,500 are endangered, the UN's cultural agency UNESCO said this week as it released its latest atlas of world languages. That represents a multi-fold increase from the last atlas compiled in 2001 which listed 900 languages threatened with extinction.

"The beginning of March 2009 marked one year since the election of Dmitry Medvedev as president of Russia. Although he announced from the outset that the fight against corruption would be one of his main priorities, his first year in office has shown that these words—as in the years of presidents Yeltsin and Putin—were nothing more than propaganda. Medvedev occupies the highest post in a state in which corruption is neither a secondary feature nor an aberration, but rather its essence. From top to bottom, corruption in post-Soviet Russia permeates the bureaucratic apparatus, the security structures and big business. Like a virus in the blood of a diseased organism, it is present in all commercial and government relations.

Wilder and his colleagues are cautious about their results also because the data do not make clear whether it was the anesthesia that contributed to the children's learning deficits, or whether it was an underlying condition that may have required surgery and precipitated the learning problems. Of the more than 5,000 babies studied, 593 needed at least one surgery and just over 100 infants needed more than two before age 3. There may be something unusual about this population of children that could have made them vulnerable to learning problems and required they undergo surgery and anesthesia.

The petrol price reductions seen across most of Australia have been short-lived for those living in the regional New South Wales city of Bathurst. An investigation by Wikinews has discovered retailers in Bathurst were late to lower petrol pricing and have been amongst the first to increase them. Following a threat by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ACCC to publically shame fuel retailers and oil companies, most fuel outlets across Australia reduced prices by 5 to 10 cents per litre. The ACCC argued that the wholesale cost of petrol was around 10 cents per litre higher than the Singapore market, which Australia benchmarks itself against.

The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127 and 8191. These numbers took a total of several weeks to verify, using different software and hardware. Each number was independently checked by several members of GIMPS' verification team, using 16-core systems of different configurations. The two primes were announced by GIMPS on September 16. Before these two discoveries, the two previously largest known prime numbers were discovered by UCMO professors Curtis Cooper and Steven Boone in Missouri, United States, and their record lasted almost three years.

"Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found in a sandstone formation in Montana. MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins.

Tuesday, January 30, 2007 The Suns had been on fire for the entire month of January. Unfortunately for them, Kevin Garnett was holding the extinguisher when the Suns came into the Target Center on Monday night. Garnett posted a double-double, scoring 44 points and snaring 11 rebounds, as the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Phoenix Suns 121-112. The loss prevented the Suns from posting a perfect record in the month of January, and ended the Suns' season-high 17-game winning streak. The Suns had problems answering Garnett's scoring prowess, but it was the Minnesota defense that doomed the Suns, limiting them to 17 points in the final quarter after allowing 95 from Phoenix in the first three periods. Steve Nash had 20 points and 18 assists, but in the fourth quarter he was only able to score 3 points and provide one assist.	Kevin Garnett was born in Minnesota.	1
