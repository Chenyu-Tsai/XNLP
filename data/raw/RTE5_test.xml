		<t>When a mosquito drinks the blood an infected person the insect also swallows the malaria parasite which then must incubate and multiply before migrating into the insect's saliva. The process can take weeks. And because mosquitoes are small-bodied and cold-blooded outside temperatures make a big difference in how long it takes before they can transmit the disease. If it happens too slowly the insects die before they can infect anyone. In general the malaria parasite does better at warmer temperatures which is why the disease occurs most often in tropical environments. But with mathematical models Thomas has found that even when conditions are warm highly fluctuating temperatures over the course of a day slow down the rate of parasite incubation and larval development in the mosquito.</t>

		<t>North Adams A seven-minute film written and directed by a MCLA freshman will make its debut next week at the Boston International Film Festival which features a line-up of independent films starring the likes of Kate Beckinsale Matt Dillon Angela Bassett and Ethan Hawke. "Initially when I shot the film it was not my intention to enter it in any festivals so I'm very excited and honored" Cody Romano 18 of Cambridge said Friday. "The film was made because of my personal interest in the poetry of Pablo Neruda a Chilean poet and it was a tribute to his work. I wasn't sure anyone else would like it. My concern was that it would only appeal to literary people and people who were fans of the poetry but I'm happy that it apparently appeals to a broader audience as well."</t>

		<t>MOSCOW (Reuters) Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he alone rules Russia and not former President Vladimir Putin in unusually direct language during an interview with the BBC aired on Sunday. Analysts have been sceptical of Medvedev's ability to govern independently of Putin while polls show most Russians think the former President is still the real power in the country. "I am the leader of this state I am the head of this state and the division of power is based on this" Medvedev said. Medvedev made no direct reference to the so-called power tandem between himself and Putin now Russia's Prime Minister.</t>

		<t>DETROIT — The Treasury Department is directing Chrysler to prepare a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing as soon as next week people with direct knowledge of the talks said Thursday. The company faces a deadline of April 30 to come up with a viable business plan supported by its creditors the United Automobile Workers union and Fiat the Italian car company that wants to acquire a stake in Chrysler. The Obama administration has told Chrysler it will provide up to $6 billion in new financing on top of the $4 billion in loans it has already given the company if Chrysler can complete a deal by next Thursday with a cost structure that gives it a chance of survival. The creditors have so far balked at the terms suggested by the Treasury.</t>

It's increasingly likely that her nomination will face a procedural hurdle requiring 60 votes before final approval at the earliest next week. The Majority Leader Senator Harry Reid Democrat of Nevada tried unsuccessfully to get unanimous consent to confirm Ms. Sebelius. But after a 15-8 vote out of the Senate Finance Committee earlier this week it had already been pretty clear that a smooth path to confirmation wasn't likely.</t>

		<t>Americans however aren't the only ones who began 2009 with a landmark inauguration. Iceland swore in Johanna Sigurdardottir on Sunday as not only the country's first female prime minister but also the world's first openly queer head of government. It is difficult to make a perfect comparison between Iceland's situation and our own; Iceland's population is less than a one-hundredth of ours and because of their parliamentary system Sigurdardottir was never popularly elected. But that doesn't mean we can't ask in a return to our initial speculation "What's coming next for America?" One of the best places to begin to unravel this puzzle is interestingly with the Republican Party. Since the 1960s the Republican Party has catered to an almost exclusively white base and has incorporated relatively few politicians from minority backgrounds.</t>

		<t>Israel was stung by the 2001 Durban conference. Despite successful pressure to remove any reference to Israel from the official closing statement the international NGO forum could not be so easily tamed. It issued a strongly worded declaration that equated Zionism with racism. It also described Israel's occupation of Palestinian land as "Israel's brand of Apartheid" and accused Israel of perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity. It was perhaps the loudest criticism so far by the international community of Israeli practices against the Palestinians. As such it was attacked by Western governments and the then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson as anti-Semitic.</t>

		<t>Israeli scientists predict the world's coral reefs could begin to collapse in as little as 30 years from now.

The team's work on corals in the Red Sea suggests a tipping point will be reached in between 30 and 70 years. Then the forces of erosion eating away at corals will outstrip the organisms' ability to make the reefs.</t>

		<t>First identified in 1930 swine flu is a common and sometimes fatal respiratory disease in pigs caused by type A influenza virus. The disease does not normally spread to humans though infections are sporadically recorded especially among people who have been directly exposed to pigs. The recent cases in Mexico and the United States however appear to have spread through human contact. From December 2005 through February 2009 only 12 cases of swine influenza were reported in the United States. In 1988 a pregnant woman died after contact with sick pigs. In 1976 swine flu at an U.S. military base at Fort Dix New Jersey killed one soldier. Four were hospitalized with pneumonia. At first experts feared the strain was related to the Spanish Flu of 1918 which killed millions but the strain never spread beyond the base.</t>

		<t>Marco Island's fringe and the surrounding Ten Thousand Islands are mostly made up of mangrove trees. Mangroves are a Florida native plant that thrives in salty water. They are able to separate the salt from the water and use the fresh water to survive. These mangrove forest ecosystems trap and cycle organic matter chemicals and nutrients. They are the nurseries for area fishes crustaceans and shellfish. They also provide food for species such as snook tarpon jack sheepshead red drum oyster and shrimp. Our recreational and commercial fisheries would drastically decline without healthy mangrove forests.</t>

"It's about making them have to deal with me. I will continue to take that approach." In addition to his 44-point night Garnett helped his team by not turning the ball over at all during the game. Such a performance was not the case for Steve Nash who turned the ball over an uncharacteristic five times during the game. The Suns had 14 turnovers as a team. It was a case of Garnett and the Timberwolves taking full advantage of the mistakes the Suns made and turning it into an opportunity to win. However the loss certainly didn't leave the Suns or their coach Mike D'Antoni discouraged. "We'll start another [streak]. This is fun."</t>

The victims 11 and nine say they were robbed and beaten in an area of fields and woodland in Edlington northern England on Saturday. Neighbours said the younger victim was found wandering a road covered in blood. The older boy was discovered semiconscious in a wooded ravine nearby. Neighbours who found them told the British media that they appeared to have been beaten slashed and burned with cigarettes. The 11-year-old victim was in intensive care with serious head injuries. The nine-hear-old needed surgery on his arm. Crown Prosecution Service spokesman Chris Hartley said each suspect faced two charges of attempted murder and two of robbery.

However appeals caused him to remain on death row for 23 years.

The camera on the telescope known as the "Advanced Camera for Surveys" or ACS can be reactivated but will be restored to only one-third of its operating capacity. The restoration will probably take place in mid-February. The camera shut down over the weekend probably due to a failure of its backup power supply. It was the third such shutdown of the camera in the past calendar year. The camera had been operating on its backup power since June 30 2006 when engineers switched from the primary power supply ("Side A") to the backup ("Side B") due to a malfunction. A review board was convened on January 29 to assess all options and to decide on a course of action. Their findings will be reported to NASA on March 2 2007.

One explication could be that somebody messed up the files filling taxes for the entire 2007 when she died in January.Also according to her will Jon Voight (Angelina's father) owns thousands of dollars in back child support.

The court did not rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriages but ruled more narrowly that San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom overstepped his authority by unilaterally deciding not to follow state laws he did not agree with instead of challenging the laws in court which is the proper legal way to overturn or affirm laws in California and much of the United States.</t>

The pond at the Millbrook Quarry will undergo treatment for three to four weeks in an effort to eliminate an infestation of zebra mussels a condition of its waters that was confirmed by state environmental officials in 2002.

		<t>HANOVER Germany Internet portal and mail-provider Lycos Europe has launched a program to increase spammers' bills by having thousands of voluntary users' computers repeatedly query websites from which spam originates. Such a tactic would increase the bandwidth costs for these websites. However it also faces legal questions. Spamming the mass sending of unsolicited emails is lucrative in part because each email can be sent for nearly insignificant costs. With such low costs a commercial spammer needs only to have a very small number of recipients buy their product to make a profit. The goal of many anti-spam proposals has been to increase the cost of spammers sending messages. Lycos' approach is to make it more expensive to maintain servers that send spam.</t>

This occurred after being asked questions about his criticism of Brooke Shields who has been taking drugs including Paxil for postpartum depression. Cruise is usually known for keeping his cool in interviews but recently he has been slightly more unbound. Cruise's statements including "Psychiatry is a pseudoscience" and "There is no such thing as a chemical imbalance in a body" reflect the beliefs of the Church of Scientology of which he is a member.

"The clear references to 9/11 in the apocalyptic ending can only bring Orwell's name into disrepute in the U.S." wrote William Hamilton the British literary executor of the Orwell estate.
