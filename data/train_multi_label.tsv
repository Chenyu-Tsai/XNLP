"The disappearance of York University chef Claudia Lawrence is now being treated as suspected murder, North Yorkshire Police said. However detectives said they had not found any proof that the 35-year-old, who went missing on 18 March, was dead. Her father Peter Lawrence made a direct appeal to his daughter to contact him five weeks after she disappeared. His plea came at a news conference held shortly after a £10,000 reward was offered to help find Miss Lawrence. Crimestoppers said the sum they were offering was ""significantly higher"" than usual because of public interest in the case."	Claudia Lawrence is 35 years old.	0	1	0	0	0	0	[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Any taxpayer earning over £150,000 will no longer enjoy higher-rate tax relief, which is considered a substantial incentive to save for wealthy workers. From April 2011, anyone who earns £200,000 a year, for example, and pays the typical amount of 6 per cent of their salary into their company pension scheme will lose out on £200 a month or £2,400 a year. Alistair Darling, when he announced the move in the Budget, insisted that just 1.5 per cent of taxpayers - the equivalent of about 450,000 people - would be hit, but experts argued that it would significantly damage the already beleaguered pensions industry, and cause many savers to think twice about investing in a pension.

Israeli scientists predict the world's coral reefs could begin to collapse in as little as 30 years from now. Studies show the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic as they soak up manmade emissions of carbon dioxide. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem researchers say this will make it difficult for many coral organisms to produce skeletal and other hard parts. The team's work on corals in the Red Sea suggests a tipping point will be reached in between 30 and 70 years.

Hunting reef sharks is now banned throughout Maldivian waters. The government decision has made the Indian Ocean archipelago the first nation in the region to outlaw the practice.

The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127 and 8191. These numbers took a total of several weeks to verify, using different software and hardware. Each number was independently checked by several members of GIMPS' verification team, using 16-core systems of different configurations. The two primes were announced by GIMPS on September 16. Before these two discoveries, the two previously largest known prime numbers were discovered by UCMO professors Curtis Cooper and Steven Boone in Missouri, United States, and their record lasted almost three years. Historically, prime numbers discovered by GIMPS are larger than the one previously found. The only other exception was when the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and 31st were found. Founded by M.I.T. graduate George Woltman in 1996, GIMPS has found 12 Mersenne primes, or about one per year on average.	Steve Boone is a member of GIMPS.	1	0	0	0	0	0	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The new Interstate 35W St. Anthony Falls Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States was opened shortly after 5 AM today. It replaces a bridge which collapsed last year, killing 13 people. A fire engine and ambulance were first across on each side. In each direction, a line of State Highway Patrol cars was followed by a formation of Department of Transportation construction trucks. A cluster of awaiting vehicles went honking across for a few minutes, then traffic returned to the sparse levels more typical of the pre-dawn period.
